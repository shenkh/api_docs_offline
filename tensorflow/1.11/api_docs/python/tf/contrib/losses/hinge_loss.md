# tf.contrib.losses.hinge_loss

``` python

    scope=None
)
```

Method that returns the loss tensor for hinge loss. (deprecated)

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2016-12-30.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.losses.hinge_loss instead. Note that the order of the logits and labels arguments has been changed, and to stay unweighted, reduction=Reduction.NONE

#### Args:

* <b>`logits`</b>: The logits, a float tensor. Note that logits are assumed to be
    unbounded and 0-centered. A value > 0 (resp. < 0) is considered a positive
    (resp. negative) binary prediction.
* <b>`labels`</b>: The ground truth output tensor. Its shape should match the shape of
    logits. The values of the tensor are expected to be 0.0 or 1.0. Internally
    the {0,1} labels are converted to {-1,1} when calculating the hinge loss.
* <b>`scope`</b>: The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.


#### Returns:

An unweighted `Tensor` of same shape as `logits` and `labels` representing
the
  loss values across the batch.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the shapes of `logits` and `labels` don't match.
