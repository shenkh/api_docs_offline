# tf.manip.scatter_nd

### Aliases:

* `tf.manip.scatter_nd`
* `tf.scatter_nd`

``` python
tf.manip.scatter_nd(
    indices,
    updates,
    shape,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in generated file: `tensorflow/python/ops/gen_array_ops.py`.

Scatter `updates` into a new tensor according to `indices`.

Creates a new tensor by applying sparse `updates` to individual values or
slices within a tensor (initially zero for numeric, empty for string) of
the given `shape` according to indices.  This operator is the inverse of the
<a href="../../tf/manip/gather_nd.md"><code>tf.gather_nd</code></a> operator which extracts values or slices from a given tensor.

If `indices` contains duplicates, then their updates are accumulated (summed).

**WARNING**: The order in which updates are applied is nondeterministic, so the
output will be nondeterministic if `indices` contains duplicates -- because
of some numerical approximation issues, numbers summed in different order
may yield different results.

`indices` is an integer tensor containing indices into a new tensor of shape
`shape`.  The last dimension of `indices` can be at most the rank of `shape`:

    indices.shape[-1] <= shape.rank

The last dimension of `indices` corresponds to indices into elements
(if `indices.shape[-1] = shape.rank`) or slices
(if `indices.shape[-1] < shape.rank`) along dimension `indices.shape[-1]` of
`shape`.  `updates` is a tensor with shape

    indices.shape[:-1] + shape[indices.shape[-1]:]

The simplest form of scatter is to insert individual elements in a tensor by
index. For example, say we want to insert 4 scattered elements in a rank-1
tensor with 8 elements.

In Python, this scatter operation would look like this:

```python
    indices = tf.constant([[4], [3], [1], [7]])
    updates = tf.constant([9, 10, 11, 12])
    shape = tf.constant([8])
    scatter = tf.scatter_nd(indices, updates, shape)
    with tf.Session() as sess:
      print(sess.run(scatter))
```

The resulting tensor would look like this:

    [0, 11, 0, 10, 9, 0, 0, 12]

We can also, insert entire slices of a higher rank tensor all at once. For
example, if we wanted to insert two slices in the first dimension of a
rank-3 tensor with two matrices of new values.

In Python, this scatter operation would look like this:

```python
    indices = tf.constant([[0], [2]])
    updates = tf.constant([[[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6],
                            [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],
                           [[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6],
                            [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]]])
    shape = tf.constant([4, 4, 4])
    scatter = tf.scatter_nd(indices, updates, shape)
    with tf.Session() as sess:
      print(sess.run(scatter))
```

The resulting tensor would look like this:

    [[[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],
     [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]],
     [[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],
     [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]]

Note that on CPU, if an out of bound index is found, an error is returned.
On GPU, if an out of bound index is found, the index is ignored.
