# Deploy

This section focuses on deploying real-world models.

* [Distributed TensorFlow](../deploy/distributed.md), which explains how to create
  a cluster of TensorFlow servers.
* [TensorFlow on Hadoop](../deploy/hadoop.md)
* [TensorFlow on S3](../deploy/s3.md)
* [TensorFlow serving](/serving), an open-source, flexible, high-performance
  serving system for machine-learned models designed for production environments.
  TensorFlow Serving provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models.
* [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](/tfx) is an end-to-end machine learning platform
  for TensorFlow. Implemented at Google, we've open sourced some TFX libraries
  with the rest of the system to come.
