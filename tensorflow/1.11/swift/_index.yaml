        <p>Swift for TensorFlow provides a new programming model that combines
        the performance of graphs with the flexibility and expressivity of eager
        execution, with a strong focus on improved usability at every level of
        the stack. Swift also catches type errors and shape mismatches before
        running your code, and has Automatic Differentiation built in.</p>
        <p>We believe that machine learning tools are so important that they
        deserve a first-class language and a compiler. To join the developer
        community, see the
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift" class="external">GitHub repository</a></p>.
