# tf.xla.experimental.compile

Builds an operator that compiles and runs `computation` with XLA.

### Aliases:

* `tf.compat.v1.xla.experimental.compile`
* `tf.compat.v2.xla.experimental.compile`
* `tf.xla.experimental.compile`

``` python
tf.xla.experimental.compile(
    computation,
    inputs=None
)
```



Defined in [`python/compiler/xla/xla.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/compiler/xla/xla.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

NOTE: In eager mode, `computation` will have `@tf.function` semantics.

#### Args:


* <b>`computation`</b>: A Python function that builds a computation to apply to the
  input. If the function takes n inputs, 'inputs' should be a list of n
  tensors.

  `computation` may return a list of operations and tensors.  Tensors must
  come before operations in the returned list.  The return value of
  `compile` is a list of tensors corresponding to the tensors from the
  output of `computation`.

  All `Operation`s returned from `computation` will be executed when
  evaluating any of the returned output tensors.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: A list of inputs or `None` (equivalent to an empty list). Each input
  can be a nested structure containing values that are convertible to
  tensors. Note that passing an N-dimension list of compatible values will
  result in a N-dimension list of scalar tensors rather than a single Rank-N
  tensors. If you need different behavior, convert part of inputs to tensors
  with <a href="../../../tf/convert_to_tensor.md"><code>tf.convert_to_tensor</code></a>.


#### Returns:

Same data structure as if computation(*inputs) is called directly with some
exceptions for correctness. Exceptions include:
  1) None output: a NoOp would be returned which control-depends on
     computation.
  2) Single value output: A tuple containing the value would be returned.
  3) Operation-only outputs: a NoOp would be returned which
     control-depends on computation.
  TODO(b/121383831): Investigate into removing these special cases.



#### Raises:


* <b>`RuntimeError`</b>: if called when eager execution is enabled.
