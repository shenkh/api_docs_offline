# tf.compat.v1.tpu.rewrite

Rewrites `computation` for execution on a TPU system.

``` python
tf.compat.v1.tpu.rewrite(
    computation,
    inputs=None,
    infeed_queue=None,
    device_assignment=None,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`python/tpu/tpu.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/tpu/tpu.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Args:


* <b>`computation`</b>: A Python function that builds a computation to apply to the
  input. If the function takes n inputs, 'inputs' should be a list of n
  tensors.

  `computation` may return a list of operations and tensors. Tensors must
  come before operations in the returned list.  The return value of
  `rewrite` is a list of tensors corresponding to the tensors from the
  output of `computation`.

  All `Operation`s constructed during `computation` will be executed when
  evaluating any of the returned output tensors, not just the ones returned.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: A list of input tensors or `None` (equivalent to an empty list).
  Each input can be a nested structure containing values that are
  convertible to tensors. Note that passing an N-dimension list of
  compatible values will result in a N-dimention list of scalar tensors
  rather than a single Rank-N tensors. If you need different behavior,
  convert part of inputs to tensors with <a href="../../../../tf/convert_to_tensor.md"><code>tf.convert_to_tensor</code></a>.
* <b>`infeed_queue`</b>: If not `None`, the `InfeedQueue` from which to append a tuple
  of arguments as inputs to `computation`.
* <b>`device_assignment`</b>: if not `None`, a `DeviceAssignment` describing the
  mapping between logical cores in the computation with physical cores in
  the TPU topology. May be omitted for a single-core computation, in which
  case the core attached to task 0, TPU device 0 is used.
* <b>`name`</b>: (Deprecated) Does nothing.

#### Returns:

Same data structure as if computation(*inputs) is called directly with some
exceptions for correctness. Exceptions include:
  1) None output: a NoOp would be returned which control-depends on
     computation.
  2) Single value output: A tuple containing the value would be returned.
  3) Operation-only outputs: a NoOp would be returned which
     control-depends on computation.
  TODO(b/121383831): Investigate into removing these special cases.
