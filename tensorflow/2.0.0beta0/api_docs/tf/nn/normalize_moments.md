# tf.nn.normalize_moments

Calculate the mean and variance of based on the sufficient statistics.

### Aliases:

* `tf.compat.v1.nn.normalize_moments`
* `tf.compat.v2.nn.normalize_moments`
* `tf.nn.normalize_moments`

``` python
tf.nn.normalize_moments(
    counts,
    mean_ss,
    variance_ss,
    shift,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`python/ops/nn_impl.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_impl.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Args:


* <b>`counts`</b>: A `Tensor` containing the total count of the data (one value).
* <b>`mean_ss`</b>: A `Tensor` containing the mean sufficient statistics: the (possibly
  shifted) sum of the elements to average over.
* <b>`variance_ss`</b>: A `Tensor` containing the variance sufficient statistics: the
  (possibly shifted) squared sum of the data to compute the variance over.
* <b>`shift`</b>: A `Tensor` containing the value by which the data is shifted for
  numerical stability, or `None` if no shift was performed.
* <b>`name`</b>: Name used to scope the operations that compute the moments.


#### Returns:

Two `Tensor` objects: `mean` and `variance`.
