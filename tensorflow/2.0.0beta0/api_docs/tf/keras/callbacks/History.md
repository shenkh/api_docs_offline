# tf.keras.callbacks.History

## Class `History`

Callback that records events into a `History` object.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback.md)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.History`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.History`
* Class `tf.keras.callbacks.History`



Defined in [`python/keras/callbacks.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This callback is automatically applied to
every Keras model. The `History` object
gets returned by the `fit` method of models.

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__()
```

Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.




## Methods

<h3 id="on_batch_begin"><code>on_batch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_batch_begin(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

A backwards compatibility alias for `on_train_batch_begin`.


<h3 id="on_batch_end"><code>on_batch_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_batch_end(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

A backwards compatibility alias for `on_train_batch_end`.


<h3 id="on_epoch_begin"><code>on_epoch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_epoch_begin(
    epoch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the start of an epoch.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should only
be called during TRAIN mode.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`epoch`</b>: integer, index of epoch.
* <b>`logs`</b>: dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this method
  but that may change in the future.

<h3 id="on_epoch_end"><code>on_epoch_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_epoch_end(
    epoch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the end of an epoch.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should only
be called during TRAIN mode.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`epoch`</b>: integer, index of epoch.
* <b>`logs`</b>: dict, metric results for this training epoch, and for the
  validation epoch if validation is performed. Validation result keys
  are prefixed with `val_`.

<h3 id="on_predict_batch_begin"><code>on_predict_batch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_predict_batch_begin(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the beginning of a batch in `predict` methods.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`batch`</b>: integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
* <b>`logs`</b>: dict. Has keys `batch` and `size` representing the current batch
  number and the size of the batch.

<h3 id="on_predict_batch_end"><code>on_predict_batch_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_predict_batch_end(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the end of a batch in `predict` methods.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`batch`</b>: integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
* <b>`logs`</b>: dict. Metric results for this batch.

<h3 id="on_predict_begin"><code>on_predict_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_predict_begin(logs=None)
```

Called at the beginning of prediction.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`logs`</b>: dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this method
  but that may change in the future.

<h3 id="on_predict_end"><code>on_predict_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_predict_end(logs=None)
```

Called at the end of prediction.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`logs`</b>: dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this method
  but that may change in the future.

<h3 id="on_test_batch_begin"><code>on_test_batch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_test_batch_begin(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the beginning of a batch in `evaluate` methods.

Also called at the beginning of a validation batch in the `fit`
methods, if validation data is provided.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`batch`</b>: integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
