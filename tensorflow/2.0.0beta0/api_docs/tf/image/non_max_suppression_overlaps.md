# tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps

Greedily selects a subset of bounding boxes in descending order of score.

### Aliases:

* `tf.compat.v1.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps`
* `tf.compat.v2.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps`
* `tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps`

``` python
tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps(
    overlaps,
    scores,
    max_output_size,
    overlap_threshold=0.5,
    score_threshold=float('-inf'),
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`python/ops/image_ops_impl.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Prunes away boxes that have high overlap with previously selected boxes.
N-by-n overlap values are supplied as square matrix.
The output of this operation is a set of integers indexing into the input
collection of bounding boxes representing the selected boxes.  The bounding
box coordinates corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained
using the <a href="../../tf/gather.md"><code>tf.gather</code></a> operation.  For example:
  ```python
  selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps(
      overlaps, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold)
  selected_boxes = tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices)
  ```

#### Args:


* <b>`overlaps`</b>: A 2-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes, num_boxes]`.
* <b>`scores`</b>: A 1-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single
  score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).
* <b>`max_output_size`</b>: A scalar integer `Tensor` representing the maximum number
  of boxes to be selected by non max suppression.
* <b>`overlap_threshold`</b>: A float representing the threshold for deciding whether
  boxes overlap too much with respect to the provided overlap values.
* <b>`score_threshold`</b>: A float representing the threshold for deciding when to
  remove boxes based on score.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).


#### Returns:


* <b>`selected_indices`</b>: A 1-D integer `Tensor` of shape `[M]` representing the
  selected indices from the overlaps tensor, where `M <= max_output_size`.
