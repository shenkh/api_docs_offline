# TensorFlow Guide

The documents in this unit dive into the details of how TensorFlow
works. The units are as follows:

## High Level APIs

  * [Keras](../guide/keras.ipynb), TensorFlow's high-level API for building and
    training deep learning models.
  * [Eager Execution](../guide/eager.ipynb), an API for writing TensorFlow code
    imperatively, like you would use Numpy.
  * [Importing Data](../guide/datasets.md), easy input pipelines to bring your data into
    your TensorFlow program.
  * [Estimators](../guide/estimators.md), a high-level API that provides
    fully-packaged models ready for large-scale training and production.

## Estimators

* [Premade Estimators](../guide/premade_estimators.md), the basics of premade Estimators.
* [Checkpoints](../guide/checkpoints.md), save training progress and resume where you left off.
* [Feature Columns](../guide/feature_columns.md), handle a variety of input data types without changes to the model.
* [Datasets for Estimators](../guide/datasets_for_estimators.md), use <a href="../api_docs/python/tf/data.md"><code>tf.data</code></a> to input data.
* [Creating Custom Estimators](../guide/custom_estimators.md), write your own Estimator.

## Accelerators

  * [Using GPUs](../guide/using_gpu.md) explains how TensorFlow assigns operations to
    devices and how you can change the arrangement manually.
  * [Using TPUs](../guide/using_tpu.md) explains how to modify `Estimator` programs to run on a TPU.

## Low Level APIs

  * [Introduction](../guide/low_level_intro.md), which introduces the
    basics of how you can use TensorFlow outside of the high Level APIs.
  * [Tensors](../guide/tensors.md), which explains how to create,
    manipulate, and access Tensors--the fundamental object in TensorFlow.
  * [Variables](../guide/variables.md), which details how
    to represent shared, persistent state in your program.
  * [Graphs and Sessions](../guide/graphs.md), which explains:
      * dataflow graphs, which are TensorFlow's representation of computations
        as dependencies between operations.
      * sessions, which are TensorFlow's mechanism for running dataflow graphs
        across one or more local or remote devices.
    If you are programming with the low-level TensorFlow API, this unit
    is essential. If you are programming with a high-level TensorFlow API
    such as Estimators or Keras, the high-level API creates and manages
    graphs and sessions for you, but understanding graphs and sessions
    can still be helpful.
  * [Save and Restore](../guide/saved_model.md), which
    explains how to save and restore variables and models.
  * [Ragged Tensors](../guide/ragged_tensors.ipynb), which explains how to use
    Ragged Tensors to encode nested variable-length lists.

## ML Concepts

  * [Embeddings](../guide/embedding.md), which introduces the concept
    of embeddings, provides a simple example of training an embedding in
    TensorFlow, and explains how to view embeddings with the TensorBoard
    Embedding Projector.

## Debugging

  * [TensorFlow Debugger](../guide/debugger.md), which
    explains how to use the TensorFlow debugger (tfdbg).

## Performance

Performance is an important consideration when training machine learning models.
Performance speeds up and scales research while also providing end users with
near instant predictions.

* [Performance overview](./performance/overview.md) contains a collection of best
  practices for optimizing your TensorFlow code.
* [Data input pipeline](./performance/datasets.md) describes the <a href="../api_docs/python/tf/data.md"><code>tf.data</code></a> API
  for building efficient data input pipelines for TensorFlow.
* [Benchmarks](./performance/benchmarks.md) contain a collection of benchmark
  results for a variety of hardware configurations.

Additionally, [TensorFlow Lite](../lite) has [optimization techniques](../lite/performance/best_practices)
for mobile and embedded devices.

## Extend

This section explains how developers can add functionality to TensorFlow's
capabilities.

* [TensorFlow architecture](./extend/architecture.md) presents an architectural
  overview.
* [Create an op](./extend/op.md), which explains how to create your own operations.
* [Custom filesystem plugin](./extend/filesystem.md), which explains how to add
  support for your own shared or distributed filesystem.
* [Custom file and record formats](./extend/formats.md), which details how to add
  support for your own file and record formats.
* [Language bindings](./extend/bindings.md), Python is currently the only
  language supported by TensorFlow's API stability promises. However, TensorFlow
  also provides functionality to create or develop features in other languages.
* [Model files](./extend/model_files.md), for creating tools compatible with
  TensorFlow's model format.

[XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)](../xla) is an experimental compiler for linear
algebra that optimizes TensorFlow computations.

## Misc

  * [TensorFlow Version Compatibility](../guide/version_compat.md),
    which explains backward compatibility guarantees and non-guarantees.
  * [Frequently Asked Questions](../guide/faq.md), which contains frequently asked
    questions about TensorFlow.
