        <p>
          TensorFlow 2.0 focuses on simplicity and ease of use, with updates
          like eager execution, intuitive higher-level APIs, and flexible model
          building on any platform. Start with the
          <a href="/beta/tutorials/quickstart/beginner">beginner notebook</a> tutorial and
          the <a href="/beta/guide/effective_tf2">Effective&nbsp;TensorFlow&nbsp;2.0</a> guide.
          Install the TensorFlow 2.0 Beta preview package:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
        <code class="devsite-terminal">pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-beta0</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          See the <a href="/install/gpu">GPU guide</a> for CUDA®-enabled cards. The
          <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/sigs/testing/faq.md" class="external">TensorFlow 2.0 community testing FAQ</a>
          contains additional compatibility and migration details.

        <h3>For beginners</h3>
        <p>The best place to start is with the user-friendly Sequential API. Create
        models by plugging together building blocks.<br>
        Run this
        <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb">“Hello World” example</a>,
        then read the guides and tutorials to learn more.</p>
        <h3>For experts</h3>
        The Subclassing API provides a define-by-run interface for advanced
        research. Create a class for your model, then write the forward pass
        imperatively. Easily write custom layers, activations, and training loops.<br>
        Run this
        <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/advanced.ipynb">“Hello, World” example</a>,
        then read the guides and and tutorials to learn more.
