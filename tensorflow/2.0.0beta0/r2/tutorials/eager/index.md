# Research and experimentation

Eager execution provides an imperative, define-by-run interface for advanced
operations. Write custom layers, forward passes, and training loops with
auto&nbsp;differentiation. Start with these notebooks, then read the
[eager execution guide](../../guide/eager.ipynb).
