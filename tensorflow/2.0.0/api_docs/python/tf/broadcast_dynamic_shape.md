# tf.broadcast_dynamic_shape

``` python
tf.broadcast_dynamic_shape(
    shape_x,
    shape_y
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py).

Computes the shape of a broadcast given symbolic shapes.

When shape_x and shape_y are Tensors representing shapes (i.e. the result of
calling tf.shape on another Tensor) this computes a Tensor which is the shape
of the result of a broadcasting op applied in tensors of shapes shape_x and
shape_y.

For example, if shape_x is [1, 2, 3] and shape_y is [5, 1, 3], the result is a
Tensor whose value is [5, 2, 3].

This is useful when validating the result of a broadcasting operation when the
tensors do not have statically known shapes.

#### Args:

* <b>`shape_x`</b>: A rank 1 integer `Tensor`, representing the shape of x.
* <b>`shape_y`</b>: A rank 1 integer `Tensor`, representing the shape of y.


#### Returns:

A rank 1 integer `Tensor` representing the broadcasted shape.
