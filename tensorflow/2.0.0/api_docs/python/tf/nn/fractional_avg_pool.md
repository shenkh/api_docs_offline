# tf.nn.fractional_avg_pool

``` python
tf.nn.fractional_avg_pool(
    value,
    pooling_ratio,
    pseudo_random=False,
    overlapping=False,
    seed=0,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py).

Performs fractional average pooling on the input.

Fractional average pooling is similar to Fractional max pooling in the pooling
region generation step. The only difference is that after pooling regions are
generated, a mean operation is performed instead of a max operation in each
pooling region.

#### Args:

* <b>`value`</b>: A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`.
* <b>`pooling_ratio`</b>: A list of `floats` that has length >= 4.  Pooling ratio for
    each dimension of `value`, currently only supports row and col dimension
    and should be >= 1.0. For example, a valid pooling ratio looks like [1.0,
    1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first and last elements must be 1.0 because we don't
    allow pooling on batch and channels dimensions.  1.44 and 1.73 are pooling
    ratio on height and width dimensions respectively.
* <b>`pseudo_random`</b>: An optional `bool`.  Defaults to `False`. When set to `True`,
    generates the pooling sequence in a pseudorandom fashion, otherwise, in a
    random fashion. Check paper [Benjamin Graham, Fractional
    Max-Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6071) for difference between
    pseudorandom and random.
* <b>`overlapping`</b>: An optional `bool`.  Defaults to `False`.  When set to `True`,
    it means when pooling, the values at the boundary of adjacent pooling
    cells are used by both cells. For example:
    `index  0  1  2  3  4`
    `value  20 5  16 3  7`
    If the pooling sequence is [0, 2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used
    twice.  The result would be [20, 16] for fractional avg pooling.
* <b>`seed`</b>: An optional `int`.  Defaults to `0`.  If set to be non-zero, the
    random number generator is seeded by the given seed.  Otherwise it is
    seeded by a random seed.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).


#### Returns:

A tuple of `Tensor` objects (`output`, `row_pooling_sequence`,
`col_pooling_sequence`).
* <b>`output`</b>: Output `Tensor` after fractional avg pooling.  Has the same type as
    `value`.
* <b>`row_pooling_sequence`</b>: A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
* <b>`col_pooling_sequence`</b>: A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
