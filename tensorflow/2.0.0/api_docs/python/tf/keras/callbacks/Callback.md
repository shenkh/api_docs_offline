# tf.keras.callbacks.Callback

## Class `Callback`





Defined in [`tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

#### Attributes:

* <b>`params`</b>: dict. Training parameters
        (eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...).
* <b>`model`</b>: instance of `keras.models.Model`.
        Reference of the model being trained.
* <b>`validation_data`</b>: Deprecated. Do not use.

The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
the current batch or epoch.

Currently, the `.fit()` method of the `Model` class
will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
it passes to its callbacks:

* <b>`on_epoch_end`</b>: logs include `acc` and `loss`, and
        optionally include `val_loss`
        (if validation is enabled in `fit`), and `val_acc`
        (if validation and accuracy monitoring are enabled).
* <b>`on_batch_begin`</b>: logs include `size`,
        the number of samples in the current batch.
* <b>`on_batch_end`</b>: logs include `loss`, and optionally `acc`
        (if accuracy monitoring is enabled).

## Methods

<h3 id="on_batch_begin"><code>on_batch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_batch_begin(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

A backwards compatibility alias for `on_train_batch_begin`.

<h3 id="on_batch_end"><code>on_batch_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_batch_end(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

A backwards compatibility alias for `on_train_batch_end`.

<h3 id="on_epoch_begin"><code>on_epoch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_epoch_begin(
    epoch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the start of an epoch.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should only
be called during TRAIN mode.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`epoch`</b>: integer, index of epoch.
* <b>`logs`</b>: dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this method
      but that may change in the future.

<h3 id="on_epoch_end"><code>on_epoch_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_epoch_end(
    epoch,
    logs=None
)
```

Called at the end of an epoch.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should only
be called during TRAIN mode.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`epoch`</b>: integer, index of epoch.
* <b>`logs`</b>: dict, metric results for this training epoch, and for the
      validation epoch if validation is performed. Validation result keys
      are prefixed with `val_`.

``` python
on_predict_batch_begin(

    logs=None
)
```

Called at the beginning of a batch in `predict` methods.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

#### Arguments:

      number and the size of the batch.
