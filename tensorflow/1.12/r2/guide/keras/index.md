# Keras

<a href="../../../api_docs/python/tf/keras.md"><code>tf.keras</code></a> is TensorFlow's high-level API for building and training deep learning models. It's used for fast prototyping, state-of-the-art research, and production, with three key advantages:

- *User friendly*<br> Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.
- *Modular and composable*<br> Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.
- *Easy to extend*<br> Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create new layers, metrics, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.

The guide [Keras: A Quick Overview](./keras_overview) will help you get started.

For a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning with <a href="../../../api_docs/python/tf/keras.md"><code>tf.keras</code></a>, see [this set of starter tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras).
