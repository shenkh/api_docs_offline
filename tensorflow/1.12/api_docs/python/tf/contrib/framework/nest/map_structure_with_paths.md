# tf.contrib.framework.nest.map_structure_with_paths

``` python
tf.contrib.framework.nest.map_structure_with_paths(
    func,
    *structure,
    **kwargs
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/util/nest.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py).

Applies `func` to each entry in `structure` and returns a new structure.

Applies `func(path, x[0], x[1], ..., **kwargs)` where x[i] is an entry in
`structure[i]` and `path` is the common path to x[i] in the structures.  All
structures in `structure` must have the same arity, and the return value will
contain the results in the same structure. Special kwarg `check_types`
determines whether the types of iterables within the structure must be the
same-- see **kwargs definition below.

#### Args:

* <b>`func`</b>: A callable with the signature func(path, *values, **kwargs) that is
    evaluated on the leaves of the structure.
* <b>`*structure`</b>: A variable number of compatible structures to process.
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Optional kwargs to be passed through to func. Special kwarg
    `check_types` is not passed to func, but instead determines whether the
    types of iterables within the structures have to be same (e.g.,
    `map_structure(func, [1], (1,))` raises a `TypeError` exception). By
    default, the types must match. To allow iteration over structures of
    different types (but common arity), set this kwarg to `False`.


#### Returns:

A structure of the same form as the input structures whose leaves are the
result of evaluating func on corresponding leaves of the input structures.


#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: If `func` is not callable or if the structures do not match
    each other by depth tree.
* <b>`TypeError`</b>: If `check_types` is not `False` and the two structures differ in
    the type of sequence in any of their substructures.
* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If no structures are provided.
