# tf.contrib.framework.argsort

``` python
tf.contrib.framework.argsort(
    values,
    axis=-1,
    direction='ASCENDING',
    stable=False,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/sort_ops.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/sort_ops.py).

Returns the indices of a tensor that give its sorted order along an axis.

For a 1D tensor, `tf.gather(values, tf.argsort(values))` is equivalent to
`tf.sort(values)`. For higher dimensions, the output has the same shape as
`values`, but along the given axis, values represent the index of the sorted
element in that slice of the tensor at the given position.

#### Args:

* <b>`values`</b>: 1-D or higher numeric `Tensor`.
* <b>`axis`</b>: The axis along which to sort. The default is -1, which sorts the last
      axis.
* <b>`direction`</b>: The direction in which to sort the values (`'ASCENDING'` or
      `'DESCENDING'`).
* <b>`stable`</b>: If True, equal elements in the original tensor will not be
      re-ordered in the returned order. Unstable sort is not yet implemented,
      but will eventually be the default for performance reasons. If you
      require a stable order, pass `stable=True` for forwards compatibility.
* <b>`name`</b>: Optional name for the operation.


#### Returns:

An int32 `Tensor` with the same shape as `values`. The indices that would
    sort each slice of the given `values` along the given `axis`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If axis is not a constant scalar, or the direction is invalid.
