# tf.contrib.graph_editor.get_forward_walk_ops

``` python
tf.contrib.graph_editor.get_forward_walk_ops(
    seed_ops,
    inclusive=True,
    within_ops=None,
    within_ops_fn=None,
    stop_at_ts=(),
    control_outputs=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/graph_editor/select.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/contrib/graph_editor/select.py).

Do a forward graph walk and return all the visited ops.

#### Args:

* <b>`seed_ops`</b>: an iterable of operations from which the forward graph
    walk starts. If a list of tensors is given instead, the seed_ops are set
    to be the consumers of those tensors.
* <b>`inclusive`</b>: if True the given seed_ops are also part of the resulting set.
* <b>`within_ops`</b>: an iterable of <a href="../../../tf/Operation.md"><code>tf.Operation</code></a> within which the search is
    restricted. If `within_ops` is `None`, the search is performed within
    the whole graph.
* <b>`within_ops_fn`</b>: if provided, a function on ops that should return True iff
    the op is within the graph traversal. This can be used along within_ops,
    in which case an op is within if it is also in within_ops.
* <b>`stop_at_ts`</b>: an iterable of tensors at which the graph walk stops.
* <b>`control_outputs`</b>: a `util.ControlOutputs` instance or None.
    If not `None`, it will be used while walking the graph forward.

#### Returns:

A Python set of all the <a href="../../../tf/Operation.md"><code>tf.Operation</code></a> ahead of `seed_ops`.

#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: if `seed_ops` or `within_ops` cannot be converted to a list of
    <a href="../../../tf/Operation.md"><code>tf.Operation</code></a>.
