# tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio

``` python
tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio(
    contents,
    file_format=None,
    samples_per_second=None,
    channel_count=None,
    stream=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_ops.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/contrib/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_ops.py).

Create an op that decodes the contents of an audio file. (deprecated)

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2018-09-04.
Instructions for updating:
This will be deleted and should not be used.

Note that ffmpeg is free to select the "best" audio track from an mp4.

#### Args:

* <b>`contents`</b>: The binary contents of the audio file to decode. This is a
      scalar.
* <b>`file_format`</b>: A string or scalar string tensor specifying which
      format the contents will conform to. This can be mp3, mp4, ogg,
      or wav.
* <b>`samples_per_second`</b>: The number of samples per second that is
      assumed, as an `int` or scalar `int32` tensor. In some cases,
      resampling will occur to generate the correct sample rate.
* <b>`channel_count`</b>: The number of channels that should be created from the
      audio contents, as an `int` or scalar `int32` tensor. If the
      `contents` have more than this number, then some channels will
      be merged or dropped. If `contents` has fewer than this, then
      additional channels will be created from the existing ones.
* <b>`stream`</b>: A string specifying which stream from the content file
      should be decoded, e.g., '0' means the 0-th stream.
      The default value is '' which leaves the decision to ffmpeg.


#### Returns:

A rank-2 tensor that has time along dimension 0 and channels along
dimension 1. Dimension 0 will be `samples_per_second *
length_in_seconds` wide, and dimension 1 will be `channel_count`
wide. If ffmpeg fails to decode the audio then an empty tensor will
be returned.
