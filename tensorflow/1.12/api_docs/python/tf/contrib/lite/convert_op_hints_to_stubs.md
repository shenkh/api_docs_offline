# tf.contrib.lite.convert_op_hints_to_stubs

``` python
tf.contrib.lite.convert_op_hints_to_stubs(
    session=None,
    graph_def=None,
    write_callback=(lambda graph_def, comments: None)
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/lite/python/op_hint.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/contrib/lite/python/op_hint.py).

Converts a graphdef with LiteOp hints into stub operations.

This is used to prepare for toco conversion of complex intrinsic usages.
Note: only one of session or graph_def should be used, not both.

#### Args:

* <b>`session`</b>: A TensorFlow session that contains the graph to convert.
* <b>`graph_def`</b>: A graph def that we should convert.
* <b>`write_callback`</b>: A function pointer that can be used to write intermediate
    steps of graph transformation (optional).

#### Returns:

A new graphdef with all ops contained in OpHints being replaced by
a single op call with the right parameters.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If both session and graph_def are provided.
