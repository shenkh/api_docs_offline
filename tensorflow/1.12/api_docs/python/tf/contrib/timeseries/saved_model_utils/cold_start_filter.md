# tf.contrib.timeseries.saved_model_utils.cold_start_filter

``` python
tf.contrib.timeseries.saved_model_utils.cold_start_filter(
    signatures,
    session,
    features
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/timeseries/python/timeseries/saved_model_utils.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/contrib/timeseries/python/timeseries/saved_model_utils.py).

Perform filtering using an exported saved model.

Filtering refers to updating model state based on new observations.
Predictions based on the returned model state will be conditioned on these
observations.

Starts from the model's default/uninformed state.

#### Args:

* <b>`signatures`</b>: The `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer returned from
    <a href="../../../../tf/saved_model/load.md"><code>tf.saved_model.loader.load</code></a>. Used to determine the names of Tensors to
    feed and fetch. Must be from the same model as `continue_from`.
* <b>`session`</b>: The session to use. The session's graph must be the one into which
    <a href="../../../../tf/saved_model/load.md"><code>tf.saved_model.loader.load</code></a> loaded the model.
* <b>`features`</b>: A dictionary mapping keys to Numpy arrays, with several possible
    shapes (requires keys `FilteringFeatures.TIMES` and
    `FilteringFeatures.VALUES`):
      Single example; `TIMES` is a scalar and `VALUES` is either a scalar or a
        vector of length [number of features].
      Sequence; `TIMES` is a vector of shape [series length], `VALUES` either
        has shape [series length] (univariate) or [series length x number of
        features] (multivariate).
      Batch of sequences; `TIMES` is a vector of shape [batch size x series
        length], `VALUES` has shape [batch size x series length] or [batch
        size x series length x number of features].
    In any case, `VALUES` and any exogenous features must have their shapes
    prefixed by the shape of the value corresponding to the `TIMES` key.

#### Returns:

A dictionary containing model state updated to account for the observations
in `features`.
