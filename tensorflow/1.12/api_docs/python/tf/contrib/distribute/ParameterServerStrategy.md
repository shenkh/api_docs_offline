# tf.contrib.distribute.ParameterServerStrategy

## Class `ParameterServerStrategy`

Inherits From: [`DistributionStrategy`](../../../tf/contrib/distribute/DistributionStrategy.md)



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/distribute/python/parameter_server_strategy.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/contrib/distribute/python/parameter_server_strategy.py).

A parameter server DistributionStrategy.

This strategy class works for both local training and between-graph replicated
training for multiple workers. If `cluster_spec` is specified, either passed
in to __init__() method or parsed from the
["TF_CONFIG" environment
variable](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/RunConfig),
variables and updates to those variables are assigned to parameter servers and
other operations are assigned to workers. If `cluster_spec` is not set, it
becomes local training where variables are assigned to local CPU or the only
GPU. When each worker has more than one GPU, operations will be replicated on
these GPUs. In both cases, operations are replicated but variables are not and
these workers share a common view for which paramater server a variable is
assigned to.

This class assumes between-graph replication will be used and works on a graph
for a particular worker. Note that each graph and worker is independent.
This means that while each worker will synchronously compute a single gradient
update across all GPUs, updates between workers proceed asynchronously.
Operations that occur only on the first tower (such as incrementing the global
step), will occur on the first tower *of every worker*.

It is expected to call `call_for_each_tower(fn, *args, **kwargs)` for any
operations which potentially can be replicated across towers (i.e. multiple
GPUs) even if there is only CPU or one GPU. When defining the `fn`, extra
caution needs to be taken:

1) Always use <a href="../../../tf/get_variable.md"><code>tf.get_variable</code></a> instead of <a href="../../../tf/Variable.md"><code>tf.Variable</code></a> which is not able
to refer to the same variable on different towers.

2) It is generally not recommended to open a device scope under the strategy's
scope. A device scope (i.e. calling <a href="../../../tf/device.md"><code>tf.device</code></a>) will be merged with or
override the device for operations but will not change the device for
variables.

3) It is also not recommended to open a colocation scope (i.e. calling
<a href="../../../tf/colocate_with.md"><code>tf.colocate_with</code></a>) under the strategy's scope. For colocating variables,
use `distribution.colocate_vars_with` instead. Colocation of ops will possibly
create conflicts of device assignment.

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(num_gpus_per_worker=0)
```

Initializes this strategy.

#### Args:

* <b>`num_gpus_per_worker`</b>: number of local GPUs or GPUs per worker, the default
    is 0 meaning CPU only.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if `cluster_spec` is given but `task_type` or `task_id` is
    not.



## Properties

<h3 id="between_graph"><code>between_graph</code></h3>

Whether the strategy uses between-graph replication or not.

This is expected to return a constant value that will not be changed
throughout its life cycle.

<h3 id="is_single_tower"><code>is_single_tower</code></h3>

Returns whether there is a single tower or multiple.

#### Returns:

A boolean. If `True`, `call_for_each_tower(fn)` will only call `fn` once.
If `False`, `call_for_each_tower(fn)` may call `fn` multiple times.

<h3 id="num_towers"><code>num_towers</code></h3>

Returns number of towers, for purposes of averaging across towers.

<h3 id="parameter_devices"><code>parameter_devices</code></h3>

Returns the list of devices used for variable and `update` placement.

<h3 id="should_checkpoint"><code>should_checkpoint</code></h3>

Whether checkpointing is needed.

<h3 id="should_init"><code>should_init</code></h3>

Whether initialization is needed.

<h3 id="should_save_summary"><code>should_save_summary</code></h3>

Whether saving summaries is needed.

<h3 id="worker_device_index"><code>worker_device_index</code></h3>

An object mapping worker device to an id.

This might be passed as an argument to `call_for_each_tower()`, as in:

```
with distribution_strategy.scope():

  def fn(device_id):
    # device_id is an integer. `fn` is being executed on device:
    #    distribution_strategy.worker_devices[device_id].

  distribution_strategy.call_for_each_tower(
      fn, distribution_strategy.worker_device_index)
```

#### Returns:

An index object, or the integer 0 if there is only a single tower.

<h3 id="worker_devices"><code>worker_devices</code></h3>

Returns the list of devices used to run `call_for_each_tower()` calls.



## Methods

<h3 id="batch_reduce"><code>batch_reduce</code></h3>

``` python
batch_reduce(
    aggregation,
    value_destination_pairs
)
```

Combine multiple `reduce` calls into one for faster execution.

#### Args:

* <b>`aggregation`</b>: Indicates how a variable will be aggregated. Accepted values
    are <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.md#SUM"><code>tf.VariableAggregation.SUM</code></a>, <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.md#MEAN"><code>tf.VariableAggregation.MEAN</code></a>,
    <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.md#ONLY_FIRST_TOWER"><code>tf.VariableAggregation.ONLY_FIRST_TOWER</code></a>.
* <b>`value_destination_pairs`</b>: A sequence of (value, destinations)
    pairs. See `reduce()` for a description.


#### Returns:

A list of mirrored values, one per pair in `value_destination_pairs`.

<h3 id="broadcast"><code>broadcast</code></h3>

``` python
broadcast(
    tensor,
    destinations=None
)
```

Mirror a tensor on one device to all worker devices.

#### Args:

* <b>`tensor`</b>: A Tensor value to broadcast.
* <b>`destinations`</b>: An optional mirrored variable, device string, or
    list of device strings, specifying the destination devices
    to copy `tensor` to. Defaults to `self.worker_devices`.


#### Returns:

A value mirrored to `destinations` devices.

<h3 id="call_for_each_tower"><code>call_for_each_tower</code></h3>

``` python
call_for_each_tower(
    fn,
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Run `fn` once per tower.

`fn` may call `tf.get_tower_context()` to access methods such as
`tower_id()` and `merge_call()`.

`merge_call()` is used to communicate between the towers and
re-enter the cross-tower context. All towers pause their execution
having encountered a `merge_call()` call. After that the
`merge_fn`-function is executed. Its results are then unwrapped and
given back to each tower call. After that execution resumes until
`fn` is complete or encounters another `merge_call()`.  Example:

```python
# Called once in "cross-tower" context.
def merge_fn(distribution, three_plus_tower_id):
  # sum the values across towers
  return sum(distribution.unwrap(three_plus_tower_id))

# Called once per tower in `distribution`, in a "tower" context.
def fn(three):
  tower_ctx = tf.get_tower_context()
  v = three + tower_ctx.tower_id
  # Computes the sum of the `v` values across all towers.
  s = tower_ctx.merge_call(merge_fn, v)
  return s + v

with distribution.scope():
  # in "cross-tower" context
  ...
  merged_results = distribution.call_for_each_tower(fn, 3)
  # merged_results has the values from every tower execution of `fn`.
  print(distribution.unwrap(merged_results))  # Prints a list
```

#### Args:

* <b>`fn`</b>: function to run (will be run once per tower).
* <b>`*args`</b>: positional arguments for `fn`
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: keyword arguments for `fn`.
      `"run_concurrently"`: Boolean indicating whether executions of `fn`
         can be run concurrently (under eager execution only), defaults to
         `True`.


#### Returns:

Merged return value of `fn` across all towers.

<h3 id="colocate_vars_with"><code>colocate_vars_with</code></h3>

``` python
colocate_vars_with(colocate_with_variable)
```

Scope that controls which devices variables will be created on.

No operations should be added to the graph inside this scope, it
should only be used when creating variables (some implementations
work by changing variable creation, others work by using a
tf.colocate_with() scope).

This may only be used inside `self.scope()`.

Example usage:

```
with distribution_strategy.scope():
  var1 = tf.get_variable(...)
  with distribution_strategy.colocate_vars_with(v1):
    # var2 and var3 will be created on the same device(s) as var1
    var2 = tf.get_variable(...)
    var3 = tf.get_variable(...)

  def fn(v1, v2, v3):
    # operates on v1 from var1, v2 from var2, and v3 from var3

  # `fn` runs on every device `v1` is on, `v2` and `v3` will be there too.
  distribution_strategy.update(v1, fn, v2, v3)
```

#### Args:

* <b>`colocate_with_variable`</b>: A created in `self.scope()`. Variables created
    while in the returned context manager will be on the same set of
    devices as `colocate_with_variable`.


#### Returns:

A context manager.

<h3 id="configure"><code>configure</code></h3>

``` python
configure(
    session_config=None,
    cluster_spec=None,
    task_type=None,
    task_id=None
)
```

Configures the strategy class.

The strategy object will be re-initialized if `cluster_spec` is given but
was not passed in the constructor.

#### Args:

* <b>`session_config`</b>: not used currently.
* <b>`cluster_spec`</b>: a dict, ClusterDef or ClusterSpec object specifying the
    cluster configurations.
* <b>`task_type`</b>: the current task type.
* <b>`task_id`</b>: the current task id.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if `cluster_spec` is given but `task_type` or `task_id` is
    not.

<h3 id="distribute_dataset"><code>distribute_dataset</code></h3>

``` python
distribute_dataset(dataset_fn)
```

Distributes the dataset to each local GPU.

<h3 id="finalize"><code>finalize</code></h3>

``` python
finalize()
```

Any final actions to be done at the end of all computations.

In eager mode, it executes any finalize actions as a side effect.
In graph mode, it creates the finalize ops and returns them.

For example, TPU shutdown ops.

#### Returns:

In eager mode, returns `None`.
In graph mode, a list of ops to execute. Empty list if nothing to be done.

<h3 id="group"><code>group</code></h3>

``` python
group(
    value,
    name=None
)
```

Shortcut for `tf.group(distribution.unwrap(value))`.

<h3 id="initialize"><code>initialize</code></h3>

``` python
initialize()
```

Any initialization to be done before running any computations.

In eager mode, it executes any initialization as a side effect.
In graph mode, it creates the initialization ops and returns them.

For example, TPU initialize_system ops.

#### Returns:

In eager mode, returns `None`.
In graph mode, a list of ops to execute. Empty list if nothing to be done.

<h3 id="non_slot_devices"><code>non_slot_devices</code></h3>

``` python
non_slot_devices(var_list)
```

Device(s) for non-slot variables.

Create variables on these devices in a
`with colocate_vars_with(non_slot_devices(...)):` block.
Update those using `update_non_slot()`.

#### Args:

* <b>`var_list`</b>: The list of variables being optimized, needed with the
    default `DistributionStrategy`.

<h3 id="read_var"><code>read_var</code></h3>

``` python
read_var(var)
```

Reads the value of a variable.

Returns the aggregate value of a tower-local variable, or the
(read-only) value of any other variable.

#### Args:

* <b>`v`</b>: A variable allocated within the scope of this `DistributionStrategy`.


#### Returns:

A tensor representing the value of `v`, aggregated across towers if
necessary.

<h3 id="reduce"><code>reduce</code></h3>

``` python
reduce(
    aggregation,
    value,
    destinations
)
```

Combine (via e.g. sum or mean) values across towers.

#### Args:

* <b>`aggregation`</b>: Indicates how a variable will be aggregated. Accepted values
    are <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.md#SUM"><code>tf.VariableAggregation.SUM</code></a>, <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.md#MEAN"><code>tf.VariableAggregation.MEAN</code></a>,
    <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.md#ONLY_FIRST_TOWER"><code>tf.VariableAggregation.ONLY_FIRST_TOWER</code></a>.
* <b>`value`</b>: A per-device value with one value per tower.
* <b>`destinations`</b>: A mirrored variable, a per-device tensor, a device string,
    or list of device strings. The return value will be copied to all
    destination devices (or all the devices where the `destinations` value
    resides). To perform an all-reduction, pass `value` to `destinations`.


#### Returns:

A value mirrored to `destinations`.

<h3 id="run_steps_on_dataset"><code>run_steps_on_dataset</code></h3>

``` python
run_steps_on_dataset(
    fn,
    iterator,
    iterations=1,
    initial_loop_values=None
)
```

Run `fn` with input from `iterator` for `iterations` times.

This method can be used to run a step function for training a number of
times using input from a dataset.

#### Args:

* <b>`fn`</b>: function to run using this distribution strategy. The function must
    have the following signature: def fn(context, *inputs).
    `context` is an instance of `MultiStepContext` that will be passed when
    `fn` is run. `context` can be used to specify the outputs to be returned
    from `fn` by calling `context.set_last_step_output`. It can also be used
    to capture non tensor outputs by `context.set_non_tensor_output`.
    See `MultiStepContext` documentation for more information.
    `inputs` will have same type/structure as `iterator.get_next()`. If the
    `iterator.get_next()` returns a tuple say `return x, y` then whose will
    be unpacked and passed to the `step_fn`; and step_fn signature would
    look like `def step_fn(context, x, y)`. If the iterator returns a single
    value say `return x` then the value is passed as is; the step_fn
    signature would look like `def step_fn(context, x)`.
    Typically, `fn` will use `call_for_each_tower` method of the strategy
    to distribute the computation over multiple towers.
* <b>`iterator`</b>: Iterator of a dataset that represents the input for `fn`. The
    caller is responsible for initializing the iterator as needed.
* <b>`iterations`</b>: (Optional) Number of iterations that `fn` should be run.
    Defaults to 1.
* <b>`initial_loop_values`</b>: (Optional) Initial values to be passed into the
    loop that runs `fn`. Defaults to `None`. # TODO(priyag): Remove
    initial_loop_values argument when we have a mechanism to infer the
    outputs of `fn`.


#### Returns:

Returns the `MultiStepContext` object which has the following properties,
among other things:
  - run_op: An op that runs `fn` `iterations` times.
  - last_step_outputs: A dictionary containing tensors set using
  `context.set_last_step_output`. Evaluating this returns the value of
  the tensors after the last iteration.
  - non_tensor_outputs: A dictionatry containing anything that was set by
    `fn` by calling `context.set_non_tensor_output`.

<h3 id="scope"><code>scope</code></h3>

``` python
scope()
```

Returns a context manager selecting this DistributionStrategy as current.

Inside a `with distribution_strategy.scope():` code block, this thread
will use a variable creator set by `distribution_strategy`, and will
enter its "cross-tower context".

#### Returns:

A context manager.

<h3 id="unwrap"><code>unwrap</code></h3>

``` python
unwrap(value)
```

Returns the list of all per-device values contained in `value`.

#### Args:

* <b>`value`</b>: A value returned by `call_for_each_tower()` or a variable
    created in `scope()`.


#### Returns:

A list of values contained in `value`. If `value` represents a single
value, this returns `[value].`

<h3 id="update"><code>update</code></h3>

``` python
update(
    var,
    fn,
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Run `fn` to update `var` using inputs mirrored to the same devices.

If `var` is mirrored across multiple devices, then this implements
logic like:

```
results = {}
for device, v in var:
  with tf.device(device):
    # *args and **kwargs will be unwrapped if they are mirrored.
    results[device] = fn(v, *args, **kwargs)
return merged(results)
```

Otherwise this returns `fn(var, *args, **kwargs)` colocated with `var`.'

Neither *args nor **kwargs may contain per-device values.
If they contain mirrored values, they will be unwrapped before
calling `fn`.

#### Args:

* <b>`var`</b>: Variable, possibly mirrored to multiple devices, to operate on.
* <b>`fn`</b>: Function to call. Should take the variable as the first argument.
* <b>`*args`</b>: Additional positional arguments to pass to `fn()`.
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Keyword arguments to pass to `fn()`. If "grouped=False" is
    specified, the return value will be unwrapped.


#### Returns:

By default, the merged return value of `fn` across all towers.  The merged
result has dependencies to make sure that if it is evaluated at all, the
side effects (updates) will happen on every tower. If instead
"grouped=False" is specified, this function will return a nest of lists
where each list has an element per tower, and the caller is responsible
for ensuring all elements are executed.

<h3 id="update_non_slot"><code>update_non_slot</code></h3>

``` python
update_non_slot(
    colocate_with,
    fn,
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

Runs `fn(*args, **kwargs)` on `colocate_with` devices.

#### Args:

* <b>`colocate_with`</b>: The return value of `non_slot_devices()`.
* <b>`fn`</b>: Function to execute.
* <b>`*args`</b>: Positional arguments to pass to `fn()`.
* <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Keyword arguments to pass to `fn()`. If "grouped=False" is
    specified, the return value will be unwrapped and the caller is
    responsible for ensuring all elements are executed.


#### Returns:

Return value of `fn`, possibly merged across devices.

<h3 id="value_container"><code>value_container</code></h3>

``` python
value_container(val)
```

Returns the container that this per-device `value` belongs to.

#### Args:

* <b>`value`</b>: A value returned by `call_for_each_tower()` or a variable
    created in `scope()`.


#### Returns:

A container that `value` belongs to.
If value does not belong to any container (including the case of
container having been destroyed), returns the value itself.
`value in unwrap(value_container(value))` will always be true.
