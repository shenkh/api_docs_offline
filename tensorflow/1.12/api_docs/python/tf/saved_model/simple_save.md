# tf.saved_model.simple_save

``` python
tf.saved_model.simple_save(
    session,

    outputs,
    legacy_init_op=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/saved_model/simple_save.py`](/code/stable/tensorflow/python/saved_model/simple_save.py).

Convenience function to build a SavedModel suitable for serving.

In many common cases, saving models for serving will be as simple as:

    simple_save(session,
                export_dir,
                inputs={"x": x, "y": y},
                outputs={"z": z})

Although in many cases it's not necessary to understand all of the many ways
    to configure a SavedModel, this method has a few practical implications:
  - It will be treated as a graph for inference / serving (i.e. uses the tag
    `tag_constants.SERVING`)
  - The SavedModel will load in TensorFlow Serving and supports the
    [Predict
    API](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/apis/predict.proto).
    To use the Classify, Regress, or MultiInference APIs, please
    use either
    [tf.Estimator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator)
    or the lower level
    [SavedModel
    APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/README.md).
  - Some TensorFlow ops depend on information on disk or other information
    called "assets". These are generally handled automatically by adding the
    assets to the `GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS` collection. Only assets in that
    collection are exported; if you need more custom behavior, you'll need to
    use the
    [SavedModelBuilder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/builder.py).

#### Args:

* <b>`session`</b>: The TensorFlow session from which to save the meta graph and
      variables.
* <b>`export_dir`</b>: The path to which the SavedModel will be stored.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: dict mapping string input names to tensors. These are added
      to the SignatureDef as the inputs.
* <b>`outputs`</b>:  dict mapping string output names to tensors. These are added
      to the SignatureDef as the outputs.
* <b>`legacy_init_op`</b>: Legacy support for op or group of ops to execute after the
      restore op upon a load.
