# tf.contrib.eager.run_test_in_graph_and_eager_modes

``` python
tf.contrib.eager.run_test_in_graph_and_eager_modes(
    func=None,
    config=None,
    use_gpu=True,
    reset_test=True,
    assert_no_eager_garbage=False
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/framework/test_util.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/framework/test_util.py).

Execute the decorated test with and without enabling eager execution.

This function returns a decorator intended to be applied to test methods in
a <a href="../../../tf/test/TestCase.md"><code>tf.test.TestCase</code></a> class. Doing so will cause the contents of the test
method to be executed twice - once normally, and once with eager execution
enabled. This allows unittests to confirm the equivalence between eager
and graph execution (see <a href="../../../tf/enable_eager_execution.md"><code>tf.enable_eager_execution</code></a>).

For example, consider the following unittest:

```python
class MyTests(tf.test.TestCase):

  @run_in_graph_and_eager_modes
  def test_foo(self):
    x = tf.constant([1, 2])
    y = tf.constant([3, 4])
    z = tf.add(x, y)
    self.assertAllEqual([4, 6], self.evaluate(z))

if __name__ == "__main__":
  tf.test.main()
```

This test validates that `tf.add()` has the same behavior when computed with
eager execution enabled as it does when constructing a TensorFlow graph and
executing the `z` tensor in a session.


#### Args:

* <b>`func`</b>: function to be annotated. If `func` is None, this method returns a
    decorator the can be applied to a function. If `func` is not None this
    returns the decorator applied to `func`.
* <b>`config`</b>: An optional config_pb2.ConfigProto to use to configure the
    session when executing graphs.
* <b>`use_gpu`</b>: If True, attempt to run as many operations as possible on GPU.
* <b>`reset_test`</b>: If True, tearDown and SetUp the test case between the two
    executions of the test (once with and once without eager execution).
* <b>`assert_no_eager_garbage`</b>: If True, sets DEBUG_SAVEALL on the garbage
    collector and asserts that no extra garbage has been created when running
    the test with eager execution enabled. This will fail if there are
    reference cycles (e.g. a = []; a.append(a)). Off by default because some
    tests may create garbage for legitimate reasons (e.g. they define a class
    which inherits from `object`), and because DEBUG_SAVEALL is sticky in some
    Python interpreters (meaning that tests which rely on objects being
    collected elsewhere in the unit test file will not work). Additionally,
    checks that nothing still has a reference to Tensors that the test
    allocated.

#### Returns:

Returns a decorator that will run the decorated test method twice:
once by constructing and executing a graph in a session and once with
eager execution enabled.
