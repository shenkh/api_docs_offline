Reads CSV files into a dataset.

Reads CSV files into a dataset, where each element is a (features, labels)
tuple that corresponds to a batch of CSV rows. The features dictionary
maps feature column names to `Tensor`s containing the corresponding
feature data, and labels is a `Tensor` containing the batch's label data.

#### Args:

* <b>`file_pattern`</b>: List of files or patterns of file paths containing CSV
    records. See <a href="../../../tf/gfile/Glob.md"><code>tf.gfile.Glob</code></a> for pattern rules.
* <b>`batch_size`</b>: An int representing the number of records to combine
    in a single batch.
* <b>`column_names`</b>: An optional list of strings that corresponds to the CSV
    columns, in order. One per column of the input record. If this is not
    provided, infers the column names from the first row of the records.
    These names will be the keys of the features dict of each dataset element.
* <b>`column_defaults`</b>: A optional list of default values for the CSV fields. One
    item per selected column of the input record. Each item in the list is
    either a valid CSV dtype (float32, float64, int32, int64, or string), or a
    `Tensor` with one of the aforementioned types. The tensor can either be
    a scalar default value (if the column is optional), or an empty tensor (if
    the column is required). If a dtype is provided instead of a tensor, the
    column is also treated as required. If this list is not provided, tries
    to infer types based on reading the first num_rows_for_inference rows of
    files specified, and assumes all columns are optional, defaulting to `0`
    for numeric values and `""` for string values. If both this and
    `select_columns` are specified, these must have the same lengths, and
    `column_defaults` is assumed to be sorted in order of increasing column
    index.
* <b>`label_name`</b>: A optional string corresponding to the label column. If
    provided, the data for this column is returned as a separate `Tensor` from
    the features dictionary, so that the dataset complies with the format
    expected by a `tf.Estimator.train` or `tf.Estimator.evaluate` input
    function.
* <b>`select_columns`</b>: An optional list of integer indices or string column
    names, that specifies a subset of columns of CSV data to select. If
    column names are provided, these must correspond to names provided in
    `column_names` or inferred from the file header lines. When this argument
    is specified, only a subset of CSV columns will be parsed and returned,
    corresponding to the columns specified. Using this results in faster
    parsing and lower memory usage. If both this and `column_defaults` are
    specified, these must have the same lengths, and `column_defaults` is
    assumed to be sorted in order of increasing column index.
* <b>`field_delim`</b>: An optional `string`. Defaults to `","`. Char delimiter to
    separate fields in a record.
* <b>`use_quote_delim`</b>: An optional bool. Defaults to `True`. If false, treats
    double quotation marks as regular characters inside of the string fields.
* <b>`na_value`</b>: Additional string to recognize as NA/NaN.
* <b>`header`</b>: A bool that indicates whether the first rows of provided CSV files
    correspond to header lines with column names, and should not be included
    in the data.
* <b>`num_epochs`</b>: An int specifying the number of times this dataset is repeated.
    If None, cycles through the dataset forever.
* <b>`shuffle`</b>: A bool that indicates whether the input should be shuffled.
* <b>`shuffle_buffer_size`</b>: Buffer size to use for shuffling. A large buffer size
    ensures better shuffling, but increases memory usage and startup time.
* <b>`shuffle_seed`</b>: Randomization seed to use for shuffling.
* <b>`prefetch_buffer_size`</b>: An int specifying the number of feature batches to
    prefetch for performance improvement. Recommended value is the number of
    batches consumed per training step.
* <b>`num_parallel_reads`</b>: Number of threads used to read CSV records from files.
    If >1, the results will be interleaved.
* <b>`num_parallel_parser_calls`</b>: Number of parallel invocations of the CSV parsing
    function on CSV records.
* <b>`sloppy`</b>: If `True`, reading performance will be improved at
    the cost of non-deterministic ordering. If `False`, the order of elements
    produced is deterministic prior to shuffling (elements are still
    randomized if `shuffle=True`. Note that if the seed is set, then order
    of elements after shuffling is deterministic). Defaults to `False`.
* <b>`num_rows_for_inference`</b>: Number of rows of a file to use for type inference
    if record_defaults is not provided. If None, reads all the rows of all
    the files. Defaults to 100.


#### Returns:

A dataset, where each element is a (features, labels) tuple that corresponds
to a batch of `batch_size` CSV rows. The features dictionary maps feature
column names to `Tensor`s containing the corresponding column data, and
labels is a `Tensor` containing the column data for the label column
specified by `label_name`.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If any of the arguments is malformed.
