# tf.keras.applications.DenseNet121

### Aliases:

* `tf.keras.applications.DenseNet121`
* `tf.keras.applications.densenet.DenseNet121`

``` python
tf.keras.applications.DenseNet121(
    include_top=True,
    weights='imagenet',
    input_tensor=None,
    input_shape=None,
    pooling=None,
    classes=1000
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/keras/applications/densenet.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/python/keras/applications/densenet.py).

Instantiates the DenseNet architecture.

Optionally loads weights pre-trained
on ImageNet. Note that when using TensorFlow,
for best performance you should set
`image_data_format='channels_last'` in your Keras config
at ~/.keras/keras.json.

The model and the weights are compatible with
TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. The data format
convention used by the model is the one
specified in your Keras config file.

#### Arguments:

* <b>`blocks`</b>: numbers of building blocks for the four dense layers.
* <b>`include_top`</b>: whether to include the fully-connected
        layer at the top of the network.
* <b>`weights`</b>: one of `None` (random initialization),
          'imagenet' (pre-training on ImageNet),
          or the path to the weights file to be loaded.
* <b>`input_tensor`</b>: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)
        to use as image input for the model.
* <b>`input_shape`</b>: optional shape tuple, only to be specified
        if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape
        has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `channels_last` data format)
        or `(3, 224, 224)` (with `channels_first` data format).
        It should have exactly 3 inputs channels.
* <b>`pooling`</b>: optional pooling mode for feature extraction
        when `include_top` is `False`.
        - `None` means that the output of the model will be
            the 4D tensor output of the
            last convolutional layer.
        - `avg` means that global average pooling
            will be applied to the output of the
            last convolutional layer, and thus
            the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
        - `max` means that global max pooling will
            be applied.
* <b>`classes`</b>: optional number of classes to classify images
        into, only to be specified if `include_top` is True, and
        if no `weights` argument is specified.


#### Returns:

A Keras model instance.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: in case of invalid argument for `weights`,
        or invalid input shape.
