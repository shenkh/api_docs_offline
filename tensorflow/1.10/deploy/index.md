# Deploy

This section focuses on deploying real-world models.  It contains
the following documents:

  * <a href="../deploy/distributed.md">Distributed TensorFlow</a>, which explains how to create
    a cluster of TensorFlow servers.
  * <a href="../deploy/hadoop.md">How to run TensorFlow on Hadoop</a>, which has a highly
    self-explanatory title.
  * <a href="../deploy/s3.md">How to run TensorFlow with the S3 filesystem</a>, which explains how
    to run TensorFlow with the S3 file system.
  * The entire document set for [TensorFlow serving](/serving), an open-source,
    flexible, high-performance serving system for machine-learned models
    designed for production environments. TensorFlow Serving provides
    out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models.
    [Source code for TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving)
    is available on GitHub.

[TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](/tfx) is an end-to-end machine learning platform for
TensorFlow. Implemented at Google, we've open sourced some TFX libraries with the
rest of the system to come.
