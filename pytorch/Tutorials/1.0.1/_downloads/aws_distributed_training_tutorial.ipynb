        "Amazon AWS Setup\n----------------\n\nIn this tutorial we will run distributed training across two multi-gpu\nnodes. In this section we will first cover how to create the nodes, then\nhow to setup the security group so the nodes can communicate with\neachother.\n\nCreating the Nodes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn Amazon AWS, there are seven steps to creating an instance. To get\nstarted, login and select **Launch Instance**.\n\n**Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** - Here we will select\nthe ``Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 14.0``. As described, this\ninstance comes with many of the most popular deep learning frameworks\ninstalled and is preconfigured with CUDA, cuDNN, and NCCL. It is a very\ngood starting point for this tutorial.\n\n**Step 2: Choose an Instance Type** - Now, select the GPU compute unit\ncalled ``p2.8xlarge``. Notice, each of these instances has a different\ncost but this instance provides 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs per node, and\nprovides a good architecture for multi-gpu distributed training.\n\n**Step 3: Configure Instance Details** - The only setting to change here\nis increasing the *Number of instances* to 2. All other configurations\nmay be left at default.\n\n**Step 4: Add Storage** - Notice, by default these nodes do not come\nwith a lot of storage (only 75 GB). For this tutorial, since we are only\nusing the STL-10 dataset, this is plenty of storage. But, if you want to\ntrain on a larger dataset such as ImageNet, you will have to add much\nmore storage just to fit the dataset and any trained models you wish to\nsave.\n\n**Step 5: Add Tags** - Nothing to be done here, just move on.\n\n**Step 6: Configure Security Group** - This is a critical step in the\nconfiguration process. By default two nodes in the same security group\nwould not be able to communicate in the distributed training setting.\nHere, we want to create a **new** security group for the two nodes to be\nin. However, we cannot finish configuring in this step. For now, just\nremember your new security group name (e.g. launch-wizard-12) then move\non to Step 7.\n\n**Step 7: Review Instance Launch** - Here, review the instance then\nlaunch it. By default, this will automatically start initializing the\ntwo instances. You can monitor the initialization progress from the\ndashboard.\n\nConfigure Security Group\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRecall that we were not able to properly configure the security group\nwhen creating the instances. Once you have launched the instance, select\nthe *Network & Security > Security Groups* tab in the EC2 dashboard.\nThis will bring up a list of security groups you have access to. Select\nthe new security group you created in Step 6 (i.e. launch-wizard-12),\nwhich will bring up tabs called *Description, Inbound, Outbound, and\nTags*. First, select the *Inbound* tab and *Edit* to add a rule to allow\n\"All Traffic\" from \"Sources\" in the launch-wizard-12 security group.\nThen select the *Outbound* tab and do the exact same thing. Now, we have\neffectively allowed all Inbound and Outbound traffic of all types\nbetween nodes in the launch-wizard-12 security group.\n\nNecessary Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore continuing, we must find and remember the IP addresses of both\nnodes. In the EC2 dashboard find your running instances. For both\ninstances, write down the *IPv4 Public IP* and the *Private IPs*. For\nthe remainder of the document, we will refer to these as the\n**node0-publicIP**, **node0-privateIP**, **node1-publicIP**, and\n**node1-privateIP**. The public IPs are the addresses we will use to SSH\nin, and the private IPs will be used for inter-node communication.\n\n\n"

        "Environment Setup\n-----------------\n\nThe next critical step is the setup of each node. Unfortunately, we\ncannot configure both nodes at the same time, so this process must be\ndone on each node separately. However, this is a one time setup, so once\nyou have the nodes configured properly you will not have to reconfigure\nfor future distributed training projects.\n\nThe first step, once logged onto the node, is to create a new conda\nenvironment with python 3.6 and numpy. Once created activate the\nenvironment.\n\n::\n\n    $ conda create -n nightly_pt python=3.6 numpy\n    $ source activate nightly_pt\n\nNext, we will install a nightly build of Cuda 9.0 enabled PyTorch with\npip in the conda environment.\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu90/torch_nightly.html\n\nWe must also install torchvision so we can use the torchvision model and\ndataset. At this time, we must build torchvision from source as the pip\ninstallation will by default install an old version of PyTorch on top of\nthe nightly build we just installed.\n\n::\n\n    $ cd\n    $ git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git\n    $ cd vision\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nAnd finally, **VERY IMPORTANT** step is to set the network interface\nname for the NCCL socket. This is set with the environment variable\n``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``. To get the correct name, run the ``ifconfig``\ncommand on the node and look at the interface name that corresponds to\nthe node's *privateIP* (e.g. ens3). Then set the environment variable as\n\n::\n\n    $ export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=ens3\n\nRemember, do this on both nodes. You may also consider adding the\nNCCL\\_SOCKET\\_IFNAME setting to your *.bashrc*. An important observation\nis that we did not setup a shared filesystem between the nodes.\nTherefore, each node will have to have a copy of the code and a copy of\nthe datasets. For more information about setting up a shared network\nfilesystem between nodes, see\n`here <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-file-system-shared-file-storage-for-amazon-ec2/>`__.\n\n\n"

        "Distributed Training Code\n-------------------------\n\nWith the instances running and the environments setup we can now get\ninto the training code. Most of the code here has been taken from the\n`PyTorch ImageNet\nExample <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet>`__\nwhich also supports distributed training. This code provides a good\nstarting point for a custom trainer as it has much of the boilerplate\ntraining loop, validation loop, and accuracy tracking functionality.\nHowever, you will notice that the argument parsing and other\nnon-essential functions have been stripped out for simplicity.\n\nIn this example we will use\n`torchvision.models.resnet18 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet18>`__\nmodel and will train it on the\n`torchvision.datasets.STL10 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.STL10>`__\ndataset. To accomodate for the dimensionality mismatch of STL-10 with\nResnet18, we will resize each image to 224x224 with a transform. Notice,\nthe choice of model and dataset are orthogonal to the distributed\ntraining code, you may use any dataset and model you wish and the\nprocess is the same. Lets get started by first handling the imports and\ntalking about some helper functions. Then we will define the train and\ntest functions, which have been largely taken from the ImageNet Example.\nAt the end, we will build the main part of the code which handles the\ndistributed training setup. And finally, we will discuss how to actually\nrun the code.\n\n\n"

        "Initialize process group\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOne of the most important parts of distributed training in PyTorch is to\nproperly setup the process group, which is the **first** step in\ninitializing the ``torch.distributed`` package. To do this, we will use\nthe ``torch.distributed.init_process_group`` function which takes\nseveral inputs. First, a *backend* input which specifies the backend to\nuse (i.e. NCCL, Gloo, MPI, etc.). An *init\\_method* input which is\neither a url containing the address and port of the rank0 machine or a\npath to a non-existant file on the shared file system. Note, to use the\nfile init\\_method, all machines must have access to the file, similarly\nfor the url method, all machines must be able to communicate on the\nnetwork so make sure to configure any firewalls and network settings to\naccomodate. The *init\\_process\\_group* function also takes *rank* and\n*world\\_size* arguments which specify the rank of this process when run\nand the number of processes in the collective, respectively.\nThe *init\\_method* input can also be \"env://\". In this case, the address\nand port of the rank0 machine will be read from the following two\nenvironment variables respectively: MASTER_ADDR, MASTER_PORT.  If *rank*\nand *world\\_size* arguments are not specified in the *init\\_process\\_group*\nfunction, they both can be read from the following two environment\nvariables respectively as well: RANK, WORLD_SIZE.\n\nAnother important step, especially when each node has multiple gpus is\nto set the *local\\_rank* of this process. For example, if you have two\nnodes, each with 8 GPUs and you wish to train with all of them then\n$world\\_size=16$ and each node will have a process with local rank\n0-7. This local\\_rank is used to set the device (i.e. which GPU to use)\nfor the process and later used to set the device when creating a\ndistributed data parallel model.

First, we initialize the model and place it in GPU memory.\nNext, we make the model ``DistributedDataParallel``, which handles the\ndistribution of the data to and from the model and is critical for\ndistributed training. The ``DistributedDataParallel`` module also\nhandles the averaging of gradients across the world, so we do not have\nto explicitly average the gradients in the training step.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a blocking function, meaning\nprogram execution will wait at this function until *world\\_size*\nprocesses have joined the process group. Also, notice we pass our device\nids list as a parameter which contains the local rank (i.e. GPU) we are\nusing. Finally, we specify the loss function and optimizer to train the\nmodel with.\n\n\n"

        "Initialize Dataloaders\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe last step in preparation for the training is to specify which\ndataset to use. Here we use the `STL-10\ndataset <https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/>`__ from\n`torchvision.datasets.STL10 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.STL10>`__.\nThe STL10 dataset is a 10 class dataset of 96x96px color images. For use\nwith our model, we resize the images to 224x224px in the transform. One\ndistributed training specific item in this section is the use of the\n``DistributedSampler`` for the training set, which is designed to be\nused in conjunction with ``DistributedDataParallel`` models. This object\nhandles the partitioning of the dataset across the distributed\nenvironment so that not all models are training on the same subset of\ndata, which would be counterproductive. Finally, we create the\n``DataLoader``'s which are responsible for feeding the data to the\nprocesses.\n\nThe STL-10 dataset will automatically download on the nodes if they are\nnot present. If you wish to use your own dataset you should download the\ndata, write your own dataset handler, and construct a dataloader for\nyour dataset here.\n\n\n"

        "Training Loop\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe last step is to define the training loop. We have already done most\nof the work for setting up the distributed training so this is not\ndistributed training specific. The only detail is setting the current\nepoch count in the ``DistributedSampler``, as the sampler shuffles the\ndata going to each process deterministically based on epoch. After\nupdating the sampler, the loop runs a full training epoch, runs a full\nvalidation step then prints the performance of the current model against\nthe best performing model so far. After training for num\\_epochs, the\nloop exits and the tutorial is complete.

        "Running the Code\n----------------\n\nUnlike most of the other PyTorch tutorials, this code may not be run\ndirectly out of this notebook. To run, download the .py version of this\nfile (or convert it using\n`this <https://gist.github.com/chsasank/7218ca16f8d022e02a9c0deb94a310fe>`__)\nand upload a copy to both nodes. The astute reader would have noticed\nthat we hardcoded the **node0-privateIP** and $world\\_size=4$ but\ninput the *rank* and *local\\_rank* inputs as arg[1] and arg[2] command\nline arguments, respectively. Once uploaded, open two ssh terminals into\neach node.\n\n-  On the first terminal for node0, run ``$ python main.py 0 0``\n\n-  On the second terminal for node0 run ``$ python main.py 1 1``\n\n-  On the first terminal for node1, run ``$ python main.py 2 0``\n\n-  On the second terminal for node1 run ``$ python main.py 3 1``\n\nThe programs will start and wait after printing \"Initialize Model...\"\nfor all four processes to join the process group. Notice the first\nargument is not repeated as this is the unique global rank of the\nprocess. The second argument is repeated as that is the local rank of\nthe process running on the node. If you run ``nvidia-smi`` on each node,\nyou will see two processes on each node, one running on GPU0 and one on\nGPU1.\n\nWe have now completed the distributed training example! Hopefully you\ncan see how you would use this tutorial to help train your own models on\nyour own datasets, even if you are not using the exact same distributed\nenvrionment. If you are using AWS, don't forget to **SHUT DOWN YOUR\nNODES** if you are not using them or you may find an uncomfortably large\nbill at the end of the month.\n\n**Where to go next**\n\n-  Check out the `launcher\n   utility <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility>`__\n   for a different way of kicking off the run\n\n-  Check out the `torch.multiprocessing.spawn\n   utility <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/multiprocessing.html#spawning-subprocesses>`__\n   for another easy way of kicking off multiple distributed processes.\n   `PyTorch ImageNet Example <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet>`__\n   has it implemented and can demonstrate how to use it.\n\n-  If possible, setup a NFS so you only need one copy of the dataset\n\n\n"
