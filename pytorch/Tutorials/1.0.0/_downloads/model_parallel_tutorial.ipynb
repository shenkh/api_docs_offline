        "\nModel Parallel Best Practices\n*************************************************************\n**Author**: `Shen Li <https://mrshenli.github.io/>`_\n\nData parallel and model parallel are widely-used in distributed training\ntechniques. Previous posts have explained how to use\n`DataParallel <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/data_parallel_tutorial.html>`_\nto train a neural network on multiple GPUs. ``DataParallel`` replicates the\nsame model to all GPUs, where each GPU consumes a different partition of the\ninput data. Although it can significantly accelerate the training process, it\ndoes not work for some use cases where the model is too large to fit into a\nsingle GPU. This post shows how to solve that problem by using model parallel\nand also shares some insights on how to speed up model parallel training.\n\nThe high-level idea of model parallel is to place different sub-networks of a\nmodel onto different devices, and implement the ``forward`` method accordingly\nto move intermediate outputs across devices. As only part of a model operates\non any individual device, a set of devices can collectively serve a larger\nmodel. In this post, we will not try to construct huge models and squeeze them\ninto a limited number of GPUs. Instead, this post focuses on showing the idea\nof model parallel. It is up to the readers to apply the ideas to real-world\napplications.\n\n**Recommended Reading:**\n\n-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions\n-  :doc:`/beginner/blitz/data_parallel_tutorial` Single-Machine Data Parallel\n-  :doc:`/intermediate/ddp_tutorial` Combine Distributed Data Parallel and Model Parallel\n\n"
